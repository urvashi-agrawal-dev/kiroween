## 🎯 Smart Response System

### How It Works

Each ghost now:
1. **Recognizes keywords** in your message
2. **Responds contextually** based on the topic
3. **Stays in character** with era-appropriate language
4. **Provides helpful examples** when asked
5. **Falls back gracefully** with period-accurate errors

### Examples of Flexible Input

**DOS Phantom:**
- "dir" → Works
- "DIR" → Works (prefers uppercase)
- "show me files" → Doesn't match, shows error
- "what is gui" → Triggers GUI rant

**UNIX Necromancer:**
- "ls" → Works
- "LS" → Works (converts to lowercase)
- "list files" → Doesn't match, shows error
- "tell me about pipes" → Triggers pipe philosophy

**BASIC Poltergeist:**
- "run" → Works
- "RUN" → Works (case insensitive)
- "execute" → Doesn't match, syntax error
- "how do i make a game" → Shows game example

**FORTRAN Oracle:**
- "calculate" → Works
- "CALCULATE" → Works (prefers uppercase)
- "compute something" → Triggers calculation
- "tell me about punch cards" → Nostalgic response

## 💡 Tips for Best Experience

### 1. Use Era-Appropriate Language
- **DOS:** Type in UPPERCASE for authentic feel
- **UNIX:** Use lowercase, terse commands
- **BASIC:** Ask about programming concepts
- **FORTRAN:** Use formal, scientific language

### 2. Explore Topics
Don't just use commands - have conversations!
- Ask about their era
- Compare to modern systems
- Request examples
- Challenge their opinions

### 3. Try Variations
- "show me" vs "how do I"
- "tell me about" vs "what is"
- Commands vs questions

### 4. Experiment!
The ghosts are designed to respond to many variations. If something doesn't work, they'll give you an era-appropriate error message.

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Chain Conversations
```
You: "DIR"
DOS: [shows files]
You: "TYPE MEMORIES.OLD"
DOS: [shows nostalgic content]
You: "What about the internet?"
DOS: [rants about BBS systems]
```

### Compare Eras
```
You: "Tell me about GUI"
DOS: "BAH! WE DON'T NEED FANCY GRAPHICS!"
UNIX: "gui? bloat. terminal is all you need."
BASIC: [Stays focused on programming]
FORTRAN: [Ignores, focuses on computation]
```

### Learn Programming
```
BASIC: "Show me a loop"
BASIC: [Shows FOR/NEXT example]
BASIC: "How about GOTO?"
BASIC: [Shows GOTO with friendly warning]
```

## 🎃 What's Different Now?

### Before (Limited):
- Only responded to exact commands: "DIR", "ls", "RUN"
- Generic responses for everything else
- No conversation ability

### Now (Intelligent):
- ✅ Recognizes keywords and topics
- ✅ Contextual responses based on meaning
- ✅ Personality-driven conversations
- ✅ Era-appropriate opinions
- ✅ Helpful examples and guidance
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks with character
