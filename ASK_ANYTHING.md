# 🎉 YES! You Can Ask ANYTHING!

## Your Ghosts Are Now Conversational

Each ghost persona now responds intelligently to **any question or topic** you throw at them, while staying in character!

## ✅ What You Can Ask

### Random Questions That Work:

**DOS Phantom:**
- "What do you love?"
- "Why are you so slow?"
- "Tell me about memory"
- "What about the cloud?"
- "Do you like mice?"
- "Tell me about games"
- "What's your favorite thing?"

**UNIX Necromancer:**
- "What do you love?"
- "Why is UNIX so cryptic?"
- "Are you fast?"
- "Tell me about modern systems"
- "What's your favorite command?"
- "Do you like games?"

**BASIC Poltergeist:**
- "Is programming hard?"
- "What do you think is fun?"
- "Why should I learn BASIC?"
- "Tell me about modern languages"
- "What do you love?"
- "How do I start?"

## 🎯 How It Works

### Smart Keyword Detection
Each ghost scans your message for keywords and topics:
- **Commands:** DIR, ls, RUN, CALCULATE
- **Topics:** GUI, internet, cloud, games, modern, love, speed
- **Questions:** why, how, what, tell me, do you

### Contextual Responses
Instead of exact matches, ghosts understand the **spirit** of your question:
- "What do you love?" → Talks about their favorite things
- "Are you fast?" → Discusses speed and performance
- "Tell me about X" → Shares opinions on topic X

### Character Consistency
Each ghost responds in their unique style:
- **DOS:** UPPERCASE, authoritative, nostalgic
- **UNIX:** lowercase, terse, cryptic
- **BASIC:** Enthusiastic, helpful, line-numbered programs
- **FORTRAN:** Formal, academic, column-formatted

### Graceful Fallbacks
If they don't recognize your question:
- **DOS:** "Bad command or file name" + helpful hint
- **UNIX:** Random cryptic error (rtfm, segfault, permission denied)
- **BASIC:** "?SYNTAX ERROR" + encouragement
- **FORTRAN:** "SYNTAX ERROR DETECTED" + formal guidance
